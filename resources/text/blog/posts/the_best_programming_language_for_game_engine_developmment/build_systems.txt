<span class="info-text-1">Build systems</span> are tools that automate the process of converting source code files into executable code. They manage dependencies and ensure that your code compiles correctly. Some of the commonly used <span class="info-text-3">C++</span> <span class="info-text-1">build systems</span> include Make, <span class="info-text-0">CMake</span>, <span class="info-text-5">Bazel</span>, <span class="info-text-6">Meson</span>, and <span class="info-text-7">SCons</span>.

On the other hand, a <span class="info-text-2">compiler</span> is a special program that processes statements written in a particular programming language and turns them into machine language or “code” that a computer’s processor uses. Some of the popular <span class="info-text-3">C++</span> <span class="info-text-2">compilers</span> are <span class="info-text-8">GCC</span> (<span class="info-text-1">GNU Compiler Collection</span>), <span class="info-text-9">Clang</span> (<span class="info-text-2">based on LLVM</span>), and <span class="info-text-5">MSVC</span> (<span class="info-text-6">Microsoft Visual C++</span>).

In game engine development, using good <span class="info-text-3">C++</span> <span class="info-text-1">build system</span> helps us gain efficient module management, code generation and much more. For example, we can use <span class="info-text-0">CMake</span> <span class="info-text-1">build system</span> to generate <span class="info-text-3">C++</span> header implementing macro tricks or including other headers automatically.
