Unlike high-level programming languages nowaday, <span class="info-text-3">C++</span> offers more <span class="info-text-0">hardware-friendly</span> features. It supports pointers, CPU intrinsic functions and the ability to embed inline assembly code, among other low-level functionalities. These features make <span class="info-text-3">C++</span> more efficient than others when it comes to support new platforms or CPUs.

Moreover, <span class="info-text-3">C++</span> programs usually can be built with <span class="info-text-2">Operation System's Software Development Kit</span> (<span class="info-text-1">OS SDK</span>) on some platform such as Windows, Unix, etc, allowing direct access to the <span class="info-text-1">OS API</span>. That means we can enable platform-specific features, which can be leveraged to optimize performance on the target platform.
