As I mentioned above, a custom resource uploader is required for overloading <span class="info-text-0">H_resource::create</span>. 
In NRE NewRG render pipeline, the general resource uploader is responsible for uploading resource data of general resources. Specifically, when uploading resource data, it creates an upload heap, maps that heap, copy all the data into and then execute a command list to copy the data from the upload heap to the target resource. This operation is quite expensive because it always create a new upload heap. However, we just need reusing all the legacy code using the simple graphics API, so it's ok to let the general resource uploader be slow.
