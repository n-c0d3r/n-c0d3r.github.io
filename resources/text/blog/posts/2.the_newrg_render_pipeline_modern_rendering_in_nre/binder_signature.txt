In DirectX 11, the resource binding model is the same across different render pipeline states/shaders: each shader stage contains multiple slots of resource.
On the other hand, in DirectX 12, it features the concept of root signature. a root signature defines resource binding slots that shaders can access during rendering. When creating a render pipeline state, we need to specify which root signature we want to use. Therefore, I added the <span class="info-text-2">@root_signature</span> annotation for NSL pipeline state object to specify which root signature the pipeline state uses.
To manage root signatures in NRE NewRG render pipeline, I created the concept of binder signature. A binder signature is an object containing a root signature, and is managed by the binder signature manager. When a NSL shader asset is compiled, it imports binder signatures into NSL shader code as macros. This allows pipeline states defined within NSL shader asset can specify their root signatures using binder signature macros.
