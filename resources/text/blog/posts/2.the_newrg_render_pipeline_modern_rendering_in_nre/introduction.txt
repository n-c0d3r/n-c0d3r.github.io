Real-time rendering is one of the most importance technologies in modern game engines. It enables the capabilities of visualizing immersive virtual environment in real-time at high frame rates. Over the years, rendering architectures have evolved significantly. Specifically, my render engine, <a href="https://github.com/n-c0d3r/NRE">NRE ðŸ”—</a>, which initially used a traditional rendering architecture, has been upgraded to support render graph and DirectX 12. This upgrade allows us to leverage modern rendering technologies such as Hardware Ray Tracing, Virtual Geometry, and much more.
