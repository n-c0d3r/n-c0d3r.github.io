In this chapter, we covered the key aspects of transitioning from a traditional render pipeline, FirstRP, to a modern render pipeline, NewRG. We dicussed about the fundamental differences between DirectX 11 and DirectX 12, how NRHI 0.2 is upgraded to support both the simple graphics API and the advanced graphics API, and some key features in NewRG such as Intermediate Descriptor Manager and Binder Signature. 
In the next chapter, we will dive deeper into the render graph implementation of NewRG. Stay tuned as we continue to unravel the intricacies of modern rendering techniques in our journey from FirstRP to NewRG.
