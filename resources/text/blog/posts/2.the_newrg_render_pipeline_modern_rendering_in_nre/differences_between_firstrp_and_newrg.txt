FirstRP, the initial render pipeline in <a href="https://github.com/n-c0d3r/NRE">NRE ðŸ”—</a>, was developed with the use of <a href="https://github.com/n-c0d3r/NRHI">NRHI 0.1 ðŸ”—</a> supporting DirectX 11. It already supports some fundamental features such as Image-based Lighting, HDRI Skies, Cascaded Shadow Mapping, etc. However, it faced the limitation that DirectX 11 is quite old and cannot support modern rendering technologies.
Therefore, I decided to create a new render pipeline called NewRG, featuring its own render graph implementation using <a href="https://github.com/n-c0d3r/NRHI">NRHI 0.2 ðŸ”—</a> with support for DirectX 12. This upgrade was quite challenging, but it provided me with valuable experience in integrating modern graphics APIs on top of an older rendering architecture.
